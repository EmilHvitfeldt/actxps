## Simulated data set

The `actxps` package includes a data frame containing simulated census data for a theoretical deferred annuity product with an optional guaranteed income rider. The grain of this data is one row per policy.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(actxps)
library(dplyr)

census_dat
```

The data includes 3 policy statuses: Active, Death, and Surrender.

```{r}
(status_counts <- table(census_dat$status))
```

Let's assume we're interested in calculating the probability of surrender over one policy year. We cannot simply calculate the proportion of policies in a surrendered status as this does not represent an annualized surrender rate.

```{r}
prop.table(status_counts)
```

## Creating exposed data

In order to calculate annual surrender rates, we need to break each policy into multiple records. There should be one row per policy per year.

The `expose_` family of functions is used to perform this transformation.


```{r example}
exposed_data <- expose(census_dat, end_date = "2019-12-31",
                       target_status = "Surrender")

exposed_data
```

Now that the data has been "exposed" by policy year, the observed annual surrender probability can be calculated as:

```{r}
sum(exposed_data$status == "Surrender") / sum(exposed_data$exposure)
```

As a default, the `expose` function calculate exposures by policy year. This can also be accomplished with the function `expose_py`. Other implementations of `expose` include:

  - `expose_cy` = exposures by calendar year
- `expose_cq` = exposures by calendar quarter
- `expose_pm` = exposures by policy month
- `expose_cm` = exposures by calendar month

All `expose_` functions return `exposed_df` objects.

## Experience study summary function

The `exp_stats` function creates a summary of observed experience data. The output of this function is an `exp_df` object.

```{r}
exp_stats(exposed_data)
```

### Grouped experience data

If the data frame passed into `exp_stats` is grouped, the resulting output will contain one record for each unique group.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

exp_res <- exposed_data |>
  group_by(pol_yr, inc_guar) |>
  exp_stats()

exp_res
```

### Actual-to-expected rates

To derive actual-to-expected rates, first attach one or more columns of expected termination rates to the exposure data. Then, pass these column names to the `expected` argument of `exp_stats`.

```{r}

expected_table <- c(seq(0.005, 0.03, length.out = 10), 0.2, 0.15, rep(0.05, 3))


exposed_data <- exposed_data |>
  mutate(expected_1 = expected_table[pol_yr],
         expected_2 = ifelse(exposed_data$inc_guar, 0.015, 0.03))

exp_res <- exposed_data |>
  group_by(pol_yr, inc_guar) |>
  exp_stats(expected = c("expected_1", "expected_2"))

exp_res

```

### `autoplot()` and `autotable()`

The `autoplot()` and `autotable()` functions can be used to create visualizations and summary tables.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, dpi = 400}

library(ggplot2)

.colors <- c("#eb15e4", "#7515eb")
theme_set(theme_light())

exp_res |>
  autoplot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = .colors) +
  labs(title = "Observed Surrender Rates by Policy Year and Income Guarantee Presence")

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
autotable(exp_res)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
autotable(exp_res) |> gt::gtsave("../man/figures/exp_gt.png")
```

### `summary()`

Calling the `summary` function on an `exp_df` object re-summarizes experience results. This also produces an `exp_df` object.

```{r}
summary(exp_res)
```

If additional variables are passed to `...`, these variables become groups in the re-summarized `exp_df` object.

```{r}
summary(exp_res, inc_guar)
```

## Shiny App

Passing an `exposed_df` object to the `exp_shiny` function launches a shiny app that enables interactive exploration of experience data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
exp_shiny(exposed_data)
```
